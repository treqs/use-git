## Install Git

Git is a **distributed version control system** that allows developers to work together on common projects and collaborate effectively with people around the world.

- You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Download and install as directed.
- Windows Users: You'll want [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/). TortoiseGit integrates with Windows File Explorer, making it fast and easy to execute most of the typical Git commands used every day. TortoiseGit is optional, but recommended for Windows users. 

## Set up Git

It is critical that you follow all setup instructions when you first install Git. You must configure Git with your full name and email address. 

Set up Git for **every repository** on your computer by following the simple instructions at:
